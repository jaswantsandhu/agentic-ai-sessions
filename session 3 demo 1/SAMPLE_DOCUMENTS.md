## Creating Test PDFs

Since the automatic PDF creation script requires additional dependencies, you can create sample PDFs manually using one of these methods:

### Method 1: Use Online Text to PDF Converter

1. Copy the content from [sample_nda.txt](sample_nda.txt)
2. Visit any online text-to-PDF converter (e.g., [https://www.ilovepdf.com/txt_to_pdf](https://www.ilovepdf.com/txt_to_pdf))
3. Convert and save as `sample_documents/sample_nda.pdf`

### Method 2: Use Google Docs or Microsoft Word

1. Open [sample_nda.txt](sample_nda.txt) in a text editor
2. Copy the content
3. Paste into Google Docs or Microsoft Word
4. Save/Export as PDF to `sample_documents/`

### Method 3: Use Python Script (if you have a virtual environment)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install fpdf2
pip install fpdf2

# Run the PDF creator
python simple_pdf_creator.py
```

### Method 4: Use System Tools (macOS)

```bash
# Convert text to PDF using textutil and cupsfilter (macOS)
textutil -convert html sample_nda.txt -output sample_nda.html
cupsfilter sample_nda.html > sample_documents/sample_nda.pdf
```
